Henchman's Quest
=============
What if you were not the hero?  What if the one who would fulfill the prophecy, the one holding the sword of legend or the staff of wisdom was NOT you?

What if you were just a regular joe living in a fantasy land, trying to make a few coppers doing whatever needs to be done.

Offer your services to the "main character" in a number of different ways.  Participate in tactical combat, solve puzzles of traps, and locks, butter up nobles, and ladies at court.
